# Topo-Ret
Topo-Ret repository contains the codes for the Topological Data Analysis used for retinal image classification.

# Feature_Extraction.py
This code contains the functions to extract topological features(Betti-0,1) from retinal images (Gray scale,  and RGB channels).

# Machine_Learning.py
This code contains the Machine Learning related tasks like XGBoost, RF, kNN etc to classify vectors(Betti-0,1) obtained from Feature_Extraction.py.
